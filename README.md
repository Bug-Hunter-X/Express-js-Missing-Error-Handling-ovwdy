# Express.js Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database operations and request input validation.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution with improved error handling and input validation.

## Bug Description

The original Express.js application lacks comprehensive error handling.  This can lead to unexpected crashes or uninformative error messages to the client, resulting in poor user experience and making debugging difficult.

## Solution

The improved version introduces several improvements:

* **Input Validation:** Checks for missing or invalid user data before attempting to create a user.
* **Database Error Handling:**  Catches potential errors during database interactions and responds appropriately.
* **Specific Error Responses:** Returns meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages to the client.
* **Centralized Error Handling:** Consolidates error handling for cleaner code.
